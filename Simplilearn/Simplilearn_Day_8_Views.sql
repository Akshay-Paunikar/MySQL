    more than 22000.

/* View Processing Algorithms:
	-- In CREATE VIEW command, there is an optional clause called ALGORITHM. This specifies how the view must be processed.
    -- In MERGE, the text of a statement is merged in such a way that parts of the view definition replace the corresponding 
    parts of the statement.
*/

/* Workflow of View Processing Algorithms (Merge): Example:
	-- Problem Statement: 
		-- You are the junior DB administrator in your organization, and your manager has asked you to change the column 
        headers of the employee table and create a new view.
	-- Objective: Create a view with the merge algorithm and specify the column headers with the changes.

SELECT FIRST_NAME, ROLE, DEPARTMENT, EXPERIENCE
FROM employee_data;

SELECT * FROM e_view

-- In TEMPTABLE, the results from the view are retrieved into a temporary table, which is then used to execute the statement.
-- The TEMPTABLE algorithm is less efficient than the MERGE algorithm, as MySQL creates a temporary table to store data 
-- from the base table.
-- UNDEFINED is the default algorithm applied when you create a view without specifying the ALGORITHM clause.
-- MySQL decides to go either with MERGE or TEMPTABLE but prefers MERGE as it is more efficient.
-- Updatable in MySQL refers to the ability of executing UPDATE and DELETE queries in the database view.
