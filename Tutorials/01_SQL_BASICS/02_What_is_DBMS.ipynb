    "\n",
    "A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify and query a database as well as manage the security and access controls for that database.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBMS provides an environment to store and retrieve data in convenient and efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, MySQL, Oracle, etc. are popular commercial DBMS used in different applications. DBMS allows users the following tasks: \n",
    "\n",
    " - <b>Data Definition:</b> It helps in the creation, modification, and removal of definitions that define the organization of data in the database. \n",
    " - <b>Data Updation:</b> It helps in the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data in the database. \n",
    " - <b>Data Retrieval:</b> It helps in the retrieval of data from the database which can be used by applications for various purposes. \n",
    " - <b>User Administration:</b> It helps in registering and monitoring users, enforcing data security, monitoring performance, maintaining data integrity, dealing with concurrency control, and recovering information corrupted by unexpected failure."
